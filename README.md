# Connected Speech Trainer

Understand linking and reduced forms, such as 'wanna' and 'gotta', in natural spoken English.

Part of the [GRE and TOEFL Study Suite](https://github.com/Apurba94/gre-toefl-study-suite): 100 free study apps for the TOEFL iBT and more. It works offline, as a Windows program or in the browser.

## Download and run

- **Windows:** download `Connected Speech Trainer.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Apurba94/toefl-connected-speech/releases/latest) and open it. Nothing to install. It opens in its own window and saves your progress in your user folder.
- **Browser:** open it online in the suite's web edition at https://gre-toefl-study-suite.vercel.app/apps/toefl-connected-speech/ . Progress stays in that browser.
- **From source:** `python launcher.py` (Python 3.10 or later, no packages needed).

## What it does

Native speakers join and shorten words: going to becomes gonna, did you becomes didja, turn it off runs together. These forms make lectures and conversations hard to follow even when you know every word. Learn 20 common reductions and match what you hear to what is meant.

Sections: Forms, Quiz, Progress, About.

## How to use it

1. Read the list in **Forms**. Say each heard form aloud, then the full form.
2. In **Quiz**, choose the full sentence for each reduced one.
3. Use reduced forms when you listen, but speak clearly on the test: the full forms are always safe.

## Good to know

- All questions, passages and definitions were written for this suite. None are official ETS questions. For official practice, use the materials on ets.org.
- It follows the GRE General Test as shortened in September 2023 and the TOEFL iBT as updated in January 2026. Formats change, so check ets.org before your test.
- Feedback on writing and speaking counts things a program can count honestly, such as length and linking words. It does not give an official score.
- Not endorsed by or affiliated with ETS. GRE and TOEFL are registered trademarks of ETS.

## For developers

The app is plain HTML and JavaScript in `web/`, run by a small Python launcher that serves it on 127.0.0.1 only and needs a secret token for saving. Tests: `node --test "tests/*.test.js"` (23 tests) and `python -m unittest discover -s tests`. Build the .exe with `python build_exe.py`.
